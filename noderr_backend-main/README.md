# To-Do List

## 1. Fix Authentication
- [ ] **Reintroduce Authentication**: Reinstate the authentication check on user connections that was removed during testing.
    - **Note:** User login works. It has been tested, but you'll need to go through the code to ensure profile data is correctly connected.

## 2. Review API Endpoints
- [ ] **Review Security**: Examine each endpoint for security vulnerabilities or incorrect logic.
- [ ] **Implement Security Measures**: Add security features where necessary (e.g., authentication, authorization, data validation).

## 3. Code Cleanup
- [ ] **Remove Unnecessary Code**: Delete unused or commented-out code that is no longer needed.
- [ ] **Optimize Code**: Check for redundant logic or performance bottlenecks and optimize where possible.

## 4. Testing and Validation
- [ ] **Unit Testing**: Create or update unit tests to cover the new or modified code.
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Test the interaction between different parts of the system to ensure they work together.
- [ ] **User Testing**: Conduct user testing to ensure the system behaves as expected and provides a good user experience.
